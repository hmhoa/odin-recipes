            This kimchi fried rice recipe is by <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/277723/kimchi-fried-rice/">Diana71.</a>

            This is a very basic kimchi fried rice, a humble dish made with leftover rice, kimchi, and usually a processed meat like SpamÂ®. In this recipe I used cubed ham and veggies I had in the fridge. Serve with a sunny side up egg over top if you like.
