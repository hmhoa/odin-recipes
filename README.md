Project: Recipes for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Overview
This is my very first project utilizing my knowledge in HTML basics as part of my journey to learn front end development and eventually become a full stack developer. You can view the site at: https://hmhoa.github.io/odin-recipes/

Within this project, I used a variety of different text elements, tags, images, and links in HTML. This was also my first time using GitHub Pages, which was an amazing feature to find out about and be able to use!

## Recipe Pages
The HTML files for each recipe can be found under ./recipes/

Each recipe page has:
- An image of the dish^1
- Description of the recipe
- Ingredients needed
- Steps to make the dish

All of the information and images I used for the site comes from recipes from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com). Source links to each individual recipe and its author is within each recipe page on the site.

[^1]: The images can be found under ./images/ or the source links for each recipe.
