Project: Recipes for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

This is my very first project utilizing my knowledge in HTML basics as part of my journey to learn front end development and eventually become a full stack developer. You can view the site at: https://hmhoa.github.io/odin-recipes/

Within this project, I used a variety of different text elements, tags, images, and links in HTML. All of the information I used for the site comes from recipes from (Allrecipes)[https://www.allrecipes.com]. Source links to each individual recipe and its author is within each recipe page on the site.
