Project: Recipes for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Overview
This is my very first project utilizing my knowledge in HTML and CSS basics as part of my journey to learn front end development and eventually become a full stack developer. You can view the site at: https://hmhoa.github.io/odin-recipes/

Within this project, I used a variety of different text elements, tags, images, and links in HTML. I also applied some basic properties to style the website within [style.css](./style.css). This was also my first time using GitHub Pages, which was an amazing feature to find out about and be able to use!

## Recipe Pages
The HTML files for each recipe can be found under [./recipes/](https://github.com/hmhoa/odin-recipes/tree/main/recipes)

Each recipe page has:
- An image of the dish[^1]
- Description of the recipe
- Ingredients needed
- Steps to make the dish

All of the information and images I used for the site comes from recipes from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com). Source links to each individual recipe and its author is within each recipe page on the site.

[^1]: The images can be found under [./images/](https://github.com/hmhoa/odin-recipes/tree/main/images) or the source links for each recipe.
